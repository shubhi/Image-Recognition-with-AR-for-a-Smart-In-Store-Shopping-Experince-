The aim of the project was to design a system to streamline the retail industry and enhance shopping experience. Using state of the art technology and AR Capabilities we were able to achieve a scope of automating the role of a salesperson. Customers can scan a product from a handheld device and obtain product information and visuals that assist the customer in the decision making process.
